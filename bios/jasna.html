            <h2>Jasna Kovac - SI</h2>
    <p>Jasna Kovaƒç graduated in nursing from the Faculty of Health Sciences of the
University of Maribor and received a master&#39;s degree in nursing from the Faculty of
Health at the University of Ljubljana. She is employed at Slovenia&#39;s largest public
hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana (UMCL), where she works as a health
care coordinator for the Pediatric Clinic. For her master&#39;s thesis, she researched the
experiences of parents of children who use cannabinoids or other cannabis
preparations for treatment. One of her findings was that these individuals want
medical doctors and nurses to be more educated on the topic in question.</p><p>
So, to gain more knowledge, in 2020, Jasna joined the ACNA - American Cannabis
Nurses Association, where she regularly attends online seminars and already holds
several of their certificates. Then in 2022, together with her colleagues, she founded
a similar association to promote the professional improvement of the knowledge of
Slovenian nurses and other health workers about treatment with cannabis and
cannabinoids. They named the association MEDCA - Association of Slovenian Nurses
and other health workers in the field of cannabis treatment. Under the chairmanship
of Jasna, MEDCA association has organized several lectures and Zoom meetings for
healthcare workers, with local and foreign experts. They are also currently in the
process of publishing a Handbook for Slovenian nurses who will be caring for patients
who use cannabis and cannabis preparations for medical purposes.</p>
