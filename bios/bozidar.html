    <p>Research Nature Institute and FIST – human rights association are monitoring the products on the
slovenian market. Both – legal and illegal.</p>
    <p>Cannabis extracts and cannabis use are widely spread among slovenian patients, mostly oncologycal,
neurological and patients with autoimmune deseases.</p>
    <p>Since the state was not able to regulate this field, patients are mostly using products from black
market or from their own production (60%). But those products are too often of poor quality and
patients are left by themselves without knowledge of proper dosing and administration ways.</p>
    <p>Quality of extracts and way of administration is crucial, so he decided to test the products in RNI lab
with HPLC and GC/MS and advise patients how to use cannabis products properly, to achieve best
results.</p>
    <p>On this way we obtained precious insight about cannabis use among patients, quality of the products
and the results.</p>
