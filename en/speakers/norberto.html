<h5>Personal impact story</h5>
<p>To what lengths would you go to give your child a better quality of life? Would you take on
your country’s government in the court of law to protect their health and wellbeing?
That is what one father, Norberto Fischer, and his family did for one of their daughters,
forever changing the Brazil’s approach to CBD in the process.
Now Norberto is a vocal advocate for CBD access in his own country and throughout Latin
America. He recently partnered with HempMeds® Brasil to become their spokesperson. He
also provides a regular column to the HempMeds® Brasil blog.</p>
